            Raiding is the primary focus of our guild, so we place special
            emphasis on its preparation. Our guild operates as a{" "}
            <span class="highlight-word-red"> 2-day raiding </span>
            team, dedicating 6 hours to progress each week. Given our time
            constraints, all preparation occurs outside of raiding hours.
            Officers work diligently to create raid plans, MRT notes, healing
            and raid assignments, and compile essential weakauras/macros. All
            raid preparations are shared in advance, allowing even our busiest
            raiders ample time to review them befors the raid. This approach
            ensures a smooth progression.
